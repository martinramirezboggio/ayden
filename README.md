# Currency convertor - Ayden

Ok, I decided to use redux to manage the state in one place, and redux-saga to create the async functions to get the data.

I will add Bidirectional conversion (user can input either source or target amount),so that if I type from the "converted rate"
any value the "from rate" will change automatically. 

And If I still have time, I think the exchange date would be good to add.

I will use transferWise currency convertor as inspiration for this project
