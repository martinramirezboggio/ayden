# Currency convertor - Ayden

Ok, I decided to use redux to manage data and redux-saga as middleware.

I will add Bidirectional conversion (user can input either source or target values),so that if I type from the "converted rate"
any value the "from rate" will change automatically. 

And If I still have time, I think the exchange date would be good to add.

I will use transferWise currency convertor as inspiration for this project

## Colours

## How it works.

After initiating the project (npm start) you will see the converter already with values, 100 Euros to start, it also displays the convertion rate of the currency to exchange which is USD dollars.
You can change the currencies and for the bidirectional conversion if you update the second box with another value the first value will be updated with the convertion to that currency.
